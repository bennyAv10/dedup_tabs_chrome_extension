# Duplicate Tab Closer Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension helps you declutter your browser by finding and closing duplicate tabs.

## How it Works

The extension scans all open tabs, identifies those with identical URLs, and closes all but the first tab it finds for each unique URL.

### 5. Use the Extension
